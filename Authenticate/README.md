This document will provide you with all the necessary information to get started with Django, a high-level Python web framework.

Installation
To install Django, follow these steps:

Install Python on your system if it is not already installed. You can download Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Install pip, the Python package manager, if it is not already installed. You can download pip from the official website at https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/.
Install Django using pip by running the following command in your terminal: pip install django.
Getting Started
Once Django is installed, you can create a new project using the following command in your terminal:

django-admin startproject projectname

Replace projectname with the name of your project. This will create a new directory with the same name as your project.

Next, navigate to the project directory and create a new app using the following command:

python manage.py startapp appname

Replace appname with the name of your app. This will create a new directory with the same name as your app inside your project directory.

Configuration
To configure your Django project, you will need to edit the settings.py file in your project directory. Here are some of the key settings you may need to configure:

DATABASES: This setting determines the database backend you want to use. By default, Django uses SQLite. You can configure this setting to use another database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
INSTALLED_APPS: This setting lists all the apps installed in your project. You will need to add the name of your app to this list.
TIME_ZONE: This setting determines the time zone used by your project.
Usage
Once your Django project is configured, you can start the development server using the following command:

python manage.py runserver

This will start the development server at http://localhost:8000/.

To create a new view, edit the views.py file in your app directory. Here is an example view:

python
Copy code
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
To create a URL pattern for your view, edit the urls.py file in your app directory. Here is an example URL pattern:

javascript
Copy code
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello, name='hello'),
]
This URL pattern will match any URL that starts with hello/ and call the hello view.
